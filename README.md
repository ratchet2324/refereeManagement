# Football (Soccer) Referee Management System

---

Current build status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ratchet2324/refereeManagement.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/ratchet2324/refereeManagement)

---
This program is designed to be easily extendable and implement an easy to use GUI for organising and paying referees.

Currently it has a basic startup interface but no functionality, as I am still writing the code for it. It is all in Java and JavaFX using gradle as the build system.
This project is for my local soccer referee branch but can be modified for other uses.
