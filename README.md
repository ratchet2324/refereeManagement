# Football (Soccer) Referee Management System

This program is designed to be easily extendable and implement an easy to use GUI for organising and paying referees.

Currently it has a basic startup interface but no functionality, as I am still writing the code for it. It is all in Java and JavaFX using gradle as the build system.
This project is for my local soccer referee branch but can be modified for other uses.

## Features
- Ability to add games (not implemented in GUI)
- Ability to add divisions (not implemented in GUI)
- Ability to add clubs (not implemented in GUI)
- Ability to add referees (not implemented in GUI)
- Everything contained inside an embedded database
- Portable jar and data file

This is still a work in progress and will update over the next few weeks/months.
