# Football (Soccer) Referee Management System

This program is designed to be easily extendable and implement an easy to use GUI for organising and paying referees.

Currently it has a basic startup interface but no functionality, as I am still writing the code for it. It is all in Java and JavaFX using gradle as the build system.
This project is for my local soccer referee branch but can be modified for other uses.

## Features
- Ability to add, remove and edit games
- Ability to add, remove and edit divisions
- Ability to add, remove and edit clubs
- Ability to add, remove and edit referees
- Ability to view all entered information (games, divisions, clubs and referees) - Not implemented yet.
- Files contained in single folder (containing subdirectories), with all files necessary to run and diagnose problems.
- Portable jar and data folder

This is still a work in progress and will update over the next few weeks/months.
